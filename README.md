### Heya, I'm Kittenz

I am a 18 year old developer specializing in full stack web development (mainly UI/UX focused but also backend), but also exploring other things!

My main work at the moment is an on-going private project that is yet to be revealed.

Other current projects include:
- [Kiku](https://github.com/kittenzexe/kiku) - An API to get your Spotify status through discord.
- [localstack](https://github.com/kittenzexe/localstack) - A simple, lightweight rust program to run multiple projects at once with a single program.
- [ocebs live](https://github.com/kittenzexe/ocebs-live) - Website for getting the current oce beat saber live sessions.
- [My personal website](https://kittenzexe.com) - All about me!

My passion is in web development with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) for frontend, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for backend and API's. I also create discord bots using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and other small things in other languages such as [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

I've been working in web dev for almost 4 years, with 2 years working with Svelte and I have been using TailwindCSS for ~6 months. I've known Javascript for 5 years and switched to Typescript 2 years ago. Known and used Python for 6 years for a wide range of different applications. And recently learning and using Rust for the past ~3 months. (I also know a wide range of other languages that you can read here: [readme-extended.md](https://github.com/KittenzExe/KittenzExe/blob/main/readme-extended.md#list-of-all-resources-and-languages-i-use-and-know)
